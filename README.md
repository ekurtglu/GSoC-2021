**Graph Neural Networks for Particle Momentum Estimation in the CMS Trigger System**

*Abstract*

The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is a detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located
near Geneva, Switzerland. The CMS experiment detects the resulting particles from the collusion and measures their kinematics using various sub detectors working in concert. High momentum muons are significant objects for many physics analyses at CMS. Therefore, an accurate momentum assignment scheme differentiating low momentum muons (background) from high momentum muons (signal) is crucial to the Endcap Muon Track Finder (EMTF) trigger. The first algorithm implemented in the trigger system was a discretized boosted decision tree. In this study, we will study the use of deep learning algorithms at the trigger level that requires microsecond level latency and therefore highly optimized inference. We will develop and benchmark the graph neural networks (GNN) for momentum regression in the trigger system. As deliverables, we will present the benchmarkings of deep network model inference for muon momentum assignment for prompt and displaced particles.
